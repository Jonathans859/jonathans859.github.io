### About Me

I'm Jonathan, a blind developer creating audio games with the [Nonvisual Gaming Toolkit (NVGT)](https://nvgt.gg). I'll also be starting an apprenticeship as an IT Specialist in Application Development (Fachinformatiker Anwendungsentwicklung) in September 2025.

On my profile, I share the code for small utilities and games I've created with NVGT, and I plan to add other projects in the future.
